# 🎵 **MFCC Feature Extraction from Audio Files** 🎶

This repository provides a MATLAB implementation for extracting **Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)** from audio files. The script allows you to load a WAV file, pre-process the audio, apply the necessary transformations, and extract MFCC features. The resulting MFCC features are then visualized in a heatmap. 🔍🎧

## Features

- 📂 **File Loading**: Load audio files using a file selection dialog box.
- 🛠 **Pre-processing**: Includes steps like pre-emphasis filtering, framing, and Hamming windowing.
- 🔊 **FFT and Magnitude Spectrum**: Fourier Transform to convert the time-domain audio into frequency domain.
- 🔼 **Mel Filterbank**: Applies a Mel filterbank to the magnitude spectrum to extract Mel features.
- 📉 **Log Compression**: Logarithmic scaling is applied to the Mel spectrum to simulate human perception of sound.
- 💻 **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)**: DCT is used to obtain the MFCCs.
- 📊 **Plotting**: A heatmap is generated to visualize the MFCCs for each frame.

## Installation

To use this code, you need **MATLAB** installed on your machine. You don't need any additional toolboxes, but make sure you have access to basic MATLAB functions such as `audioread`, `fft`, and `dct`. 💻✨

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the script. 📥
2. Ensure your audio file is in the **WAV** format. 🎧
3. Run the script in **MATLAB**. 🖥️
4. Select the audio file using the UI dialog that appears when the script is run. 📝
5. The script will process the audio and display the MFCC features in a heatmap. 🔥

## Code Overview

### 1. Audio File Loading 📂
The script allows you to load an audio file via a file selection dialog using `uigetfile`.

```matlab
[filename, pathname] = uigetfile('*.wav', 'Select a WAV file');
if isequal(filename, 0)
    error('No file selected.');
end
[audioData, fs] = audioread(fullfile(pathname, filename));
```

### 2. Pre-processing 🔄
- **Pre-emphasis**: A high-pass filter is applied to the audio data to boost the high-frequency components.
- **Framing**: The audio signal is divided into overlapping frames.
- **Hamming Window**: A Hamming window is applied to each frame to reduce spectral leakage.

```matlab
preEmphasis = 0.97;
audioData = filter([1, -preEmphasis], 1, audioData);
```

### 3. Fourier Transform and Magnitude Spectrum 🔊
- The script computes the **FFT** of each frame to obtain the magnitude spectrum.

```matlab
magnitudeSpectrum = abs(fft(frames, fftSize));
```

### 4. Mel Filterbank 🎚️
- The Mel filterbank is created using the **Mel scale** and applied to the magnitude spectrum to obtain Mel features.

```matlab
melFilters = melFilterbank(lowFreq, highFreq, numFilters, fftSize, fs);
```

### 5. Logarithmic Compression 📉
- The Mel spectrum is logarithmically compressed to simulate human hearing.

```matlab
melSpectrum = log(melSpectrum + eps); % Add eps to avoid log(0)
```

### 6. Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) 🎛️
- The DCT is applied to the Mel spectrum to obtain the final MFCCs.

```matlab
mfccFeatures = dct(melSpectrum);
```

### 7. Plotting MFCC Features 📊
- A heatmap is generated to visualize the extracted MFCC features.

```matlab
figure;
imagesc(mfccFeatures);
axis xy;
colorbar;
xlabel('Frame Index');
ylabel('MFCC Coefficients');
title('MFCC Feature Extraction');
```

### 8. Mel Filterbank and Frequency Conversion Functions 🔧

The `melFilterbank`, `hz2mel`, and `mel2hz` functions are responsible for creating the Mel filterbank and converting between Mel and Hertz scales.

```matlab
function melFilters = melFilterbank(lowFreq, highFreq, numFilters, fftSize, fs)
    % Mel filterbank function implementation
end

function mel = hz2mel(hz)
    mel = 1127 * log(1 + hz / 700);
end

function hz = mel2hz(mel)
    hz = 700 * (exp(mel / 1127) - 1);
end
```

## Parameters ⚙️

- `frameLength` (default: `256`): The length of each frame in samples.
- `frameShift` (default: `128`): The shift between frames in samples.
- `numFilters` (default: `26`): The number of Mel filterbank filters.
- `numCoeffs` (default: `13`): The number of MFCC coefficients to keep.
- `fftSize` (default: `512`): The size of the FFT, typically a power of 2.

## Example Usage 🚀

After running the script, select an audio file when prompted, and the script will output a visual representation of the MFCCs for the selected audio file.

```bash
>> Run the script in MATLAB
```

## Dependencies 📦

- **MATLAB R2018b or newer** (for `audioread` function and built-in functions like `fft` and `dct`).
- **WAV file**: The audio file to be processed should be in **WAV** format.
